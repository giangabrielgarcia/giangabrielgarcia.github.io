             <h2 className='center'>About Me</h2>
             <p>I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href = "https://www.isye.gatech.edu/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering</a> (ISyE) at Georgia Tech. 
		    In my research, I am interested in designing data-driven frameworks as motivated by high-impact problems in Health Policy, Personalized Medicine,and Medical Decision-Making. 
		    I am especially interested in how health equity and social dynamics impact decision-making at the patient, physician, operational, and policy levels. 
		    This research area draws problems which have both practical impact and interesting theoretical challenges.</p>
            <p>My research integrates predictive and prescriptive analytics, drawing on methodologies from data science, machine learning, stochastic modeling, and stochastic optimization. 
		    My current projects include applications in a broad range of disease and health areas including concussion, the opioid crisis, and chronic disease management. </p>
            <p>Prior to joining ISyE, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the <a href="https://www.mgh-ita.org/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Massachusetts General Hospital Institute for Technology Assessment</a> at the Harvard Medical School. 
		    I obtained my PhD in 2020 and MS in 2016 from the <a href="https://ioe.engin.umich.edu" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering</a> at the University of Michigan
		    and my BS in Industrial Engineering from the <a href ="https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/Departments/Industrial/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>University of Pittsburgh</a> in 2014.</p>
            <p>In my service efforts, I am interested in increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM through mentorship and outreach.</p>
