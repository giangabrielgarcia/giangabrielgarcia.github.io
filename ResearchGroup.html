				<p> MS in Statistics (Expected 2021)</p>
				<p> I am an MS student in Statistics in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech. In May 2020, I graduated from the University of Maryland College Park with a BS in Mathematics and Economics. 
				My research interest lies at the intersection of statistics, operations research, and economics with applications to healthcare. I am especially interested in the interface between behavioral modeling and how we use that in decision-making. 
				Currently, I am working with Dr. Garcia on a behavioral modeling project to investigate the concussion-reporting behavior and intentions based on both biological and social/environmental factors of athletes.</p>
